explanation:
the larger the array, the longer it takes for both functions. Insert takes less time for very small arrays but when larger than the medium size it begins to longer than append, and when the array becomes very large it takes significantly longer. Append scales much better with size. Insert takes longer because the computer needs to shift every element of the array by 1 index number, giving it an O(n) complexity whereas append just tacks something on the end, an O(1) complexity.
